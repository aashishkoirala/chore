### To Do
##### By [Aashish Koirala](http://aashishkoirala.github.io)

A very light-weight to-do application. I built this for personal user, but you're more than welcome to use it too. It lets you create tasks or "to-do items" - assign due dates (and optionally start dates) to them, categorize them, mark them as started, paused or complete, etc.

###### Initial Release (v0.1.0)
This version consists of the following features:

+ View a list of your to-do items for today (i.e. due or starting today), items that are due today, items that are supposed to start today, items that are due or are supposed to start this week, completed items, or a list of items based on criteria you specify.
+ Create new items and assign dates and categories to them.
+ For an item in the list, start it, pause it, mark it as done or delete it.
+ Perform all the above operations in bulk on multiple items.
+ Create and nest categories.
+ Import a list of items from tab-delimited text.
